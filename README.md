# EIRVA: Equity Investment Recommendation and Visualization Analysis.

The main features of this repositary are:
1. Risk Factor decomposition of an input portfolio of stocks: for better understanding of factor exposures of a portfolio
2. Clustering of stocks in the portfolio by unsupervised learning: to understand if there might be themes or similarities among these stocks that explains such clustering
3. Recommendation of other stocks not in the portfolio that have similar characteristics as those inside: to identify potential substitute investments that have higher risk-return.
4. Visualization of data to explain the analysis performed, and implement interactivity as a way to allow user to adjust parameters of analysis: this will enable user to perform variations of analysis without changing code.
